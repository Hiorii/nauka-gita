        <h2>Humble and Grumble</h2>
        <i> by Eldred Herbert </i>
        <p>Humble and Grumble were identical twins,<br>
        And Humble was ever so meek;<br>
        Grumble did nothing but grumble all day,<br>
        Some may even call him a freak.<br><br>

        Humble was happy and everyone’s friend,<br>
        Grumble was jealous of course;<br>
        Humble was happy to follow the Lord,<br>
        But Grumble, an immoral source.<br><br>

        Humble was never seen wearing a frown,<br>
        And Grumble, ne’er seen with a smile;<br>
        Humble won friends by just being himself,<br>
        But, Grumble, he won them by guile.<br><br>

        So Grumble, please follow Humble, your twin,<br>
        And Humble, don’t grumble, I pray,<br>
        For grumble will make you like Grumble, your twin,<br>
        Please Grumble, be humble today.</p>
